# MacOS Buildout

This repo acts as a log for my buildout of my laptop. As I add stuff or change settings, I log it here so pave & restores can go quickly in the future. Feel free to fork & customize to your liking.

Install apps from the Apple App Store.

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovozeto/macOS-postinstall/master/installer.sh)"
