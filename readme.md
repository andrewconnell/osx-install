# MacOS Buildout

Hi!
This repo hosts some scripts I use to quickly setup my friends and family's Mac computers. 

To start open Terminal in macOS and paste the following line

```console
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovozeto/macOS-postinstall/master/installer.sh)}
```


Special thanks to @andrewconnell and his amazong original repo:
